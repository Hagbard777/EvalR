# EvalR
R Code to Support Research and Evaluation

This repository contains code in the programming language R that is useful for evaluators and researchers, partricularly social science researchers. I am a community psychologist, evaluator, and research statistician and have created this page to primarilly serve two groups:

1. Program evaluators: The code will help evaluators manage and analyze data using common evaluation designs, such as survey research and   pretest-posttest designs.
2. Social science researchers: The code will help replicate some basic functions of SPSS and provide useful functions for the analysis of relatively small (N < 500) datasets that are commmon in social science research such as psychology.
